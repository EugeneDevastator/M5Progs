# M5Progs

# LocalMQTT
Local network python based mqtt broker

# BMP180
PYthon code to get a handle of bmp180 bosch pressure and temp sensor.

# blockfactory
This is extracted folder from blockly repo. It looks like uiflow supports it syntax already, so it is possible to make blocks in blockly with more broad customization and have them in uiflow.


This is WIP, however some customizations were made to make code appear on export tab.
You will need to get full repo and start it via:
```
npm install
npm run build
python -m http.server
```

Yes you need hosted server.
