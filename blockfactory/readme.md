see sampleblock.m5b

it looks like original m5b has lots of junk,
you can rename library as you wish
you only need one json string, others dont matter.
so basically take sampleblock.txt
convert all newlines to \n
and " to \"
also if you already have \n it must be converted to \\n 

also see davecoffee2.m5b
simply it is one long code block, and blcok defs above;
